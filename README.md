A unity project inspired by Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code particle system example.

Here's a link to the tutorial that inspired this project:

I wanted to see if I could apply what I learned in Processing to Unity. I had to make several organizational changes to make use of Unity 
physics, and the Unity Start and Update methods. I'm not sure If I used the best practices, so any feedback is welcome. You may want to 
adjust some public variables in the Unity interface to get the desired behavior.
